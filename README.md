# 128-Bit-Integer
Open Source 128 Bit integer datatype (struct) for C and C++. To ensure portability for (almost) all compilers and platforms, no compiler-intrinsics or (inline) assembly code is used. Although this may change in the future, portability of the source code will always be guaranteed.

**NOTE:** It is currently not possible to divide numbers!
